## Getting Started

## Test Site

https://chedda-liart.vercel.app

## Pattern
https://zsa.vercel.app/docs/introduction

I am really liking this pattern, I have left much duplication in this app @yordi as I am not yet sure on how I'd like to create
the abstractions for ZSA.

I LOVE that there is not a single client library, and really nice type safety into server actions, calling server actions client
side is a nice touch.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
